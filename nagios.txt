To install and configure the
nagios_server follow the below steps:


sudo su -


vi nagios.sh
yum -y install httpd php gcc glibc glibc-common wget perl gd gd-devel unzip zip
useradd nagios
groupadd nagcmd
usermod -a -G nagcmd nagios
usermod -a -G nagcmd apache
cd /tmp/
wget https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.3.2.tar.gz
tar -zxvf nagios-4.3.2.tar.gz
cd /tmp/nagios-4.3.2
./configure --with-nagios-group=nagios --with-command-group=nagcmd
make all
make install
make install-init
make install-config
make install-commandmode
make install-webconf
make install-exfoliation
systemctl restart httpd
systemctl enable httpd
htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin


sh nagios.sh 
  
(After running this command you have to give password
New password: 
Re-type new password:)

(Inside security groups allow  all traffic to acces all the ports.
Copy the “Public_IP” of the instance and paste it in the chrome along with /nagios)



(Now we have to configure the “contacts.cfg” present in the path given below and edit it by adding the email)

vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg


(Now we have to install the nagios plugin in the nagios_server to do it follow below steps)


vi nagios_plugin.sh

cd /tmp
wget https://nagios-plugins.org/download/nagios-plugins-2.2.1.tar.gz
tar -zxvf nagios-plugins-2.2.1.tar.gz
cd /tmp/nagios-plugins-2.2.1/
./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios
make
make install
/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
service nagios start
chkconfig nagios on



sh nagios_plugin.sh


(Warnings and errors should be zero.)
(Now go and refresh the nagios website you will be seeing that nagios is running and working fine.)




ON REMOTE MONITORING CLIENT SERVER Connect the instance of remote_monitoring


To install the nagios plugin and NRPE plugin follow the below steps 



rpm -ivh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm 
yum install -y nrpe nagios-plugins-all


(Go to the “nrpe.cfg” file and add the Public_IP in the sectioned called allowed hosts as shown below, 
In the same file you can also see there are commands to check several services of the remote server.)

vi /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg 


systemctl start nrpe

systemctl enable nrpe





ON NAGIOS SERVER




To install follow the steps given below


rpm -ivh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
yum -y install nagios-plugins-nrpe 


Go to the file given below and add the or comment the section mentioned below


vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

#cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers




(create one folder called servers in the below mentioned path) 

mkdir /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers


Go to commands.cfg file and add the following Nagios command definition to the file.

vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg



# .check_nrpe. command definition
define command {
command_name check_nrpe
command_line /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -t 30 -c $ARG1$
}



Now go to the servers directory that already created in the previous  step ,
 create one file with .cfg extension and add the content mentioned below


 cd /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers

vi hosts.cfg

define host{
use linux-server
host_name SkillRary
alias SkillRary
address 13.233.64.134
}

define hostgroup{
hostgroup_name linux-server
alias Linux Servers 
members SkillRary
}
define service{ 
use    local-service
 host_name    SkillRary
 service_description   SWAP Uasge 
check_command    check_nrpe!check_swap
 } 
define service{
 use local-service
 host_name SkillRary 
service_description Root / Partition
 check_command check_nrpe!check_root
 } 
define service{ 
use local-service
 host_name SkillRary
 service_description Current Users 
check_command check_nrpe!check_users
 } 

define service{

 use local-service
 host_name SkillRary 
service_description Total Processes 
check_command check_nrpe!check_total_procs
 } 
define service{ 
use local-service
 host_name SkillRary
 service_description Current Load 
check_command check_nrpe!check_load 
}


Check is there any errors in the nagios server by typing the command given below

/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg


Restart the Nagios by using the command given below

systemctl restart nagios

Now go and check in Nagios website your host will be added but it will be down so we have to add the ping security group
 in the nagios_server and remote_hosting server security groups >ALL ICMP - IPV4
